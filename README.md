# Welcome to my dotfiles!

They're finally organized (for now). I've started using stow to manage my
dotfiles using symlinks. If you're interested in figuring out how that works
for yourself, [here][blog] is a great blog post on it. Note that there are some
initial steps you'll need to clone my entire config.

## GNU Stow

Easiest path:

1. Create `~/dotfiles`
2. Create directory structure relative as if the `dotfiles` directory was `~`
3. Move existing files into the dotfiles directory. For example: `mv ~/.config/doom/* ~/dotfiles/doom/.config/doom/`
4. `stow doom` (or whatever package you just added)

```sh
├── banner
│   └── banner
├── doom
│   └── .config
│       └── doom
│           ├── config.el
│           ├── custom.el
│           ├── init.el
│           └── packages.el
├── polybar
│   └── .config
│       └── polybar
│           ├── config
│           ├── launch.sh
│           ├── power.sh
│           └── scripts
│               └── weather.sh
├── nvim
│   └── .config
│       └── nvim
├── i3
│   └── .config
│       └── i3
│           ├── config
│           └── config-old
└── zsh
    └── .zshrc
```

If you already have an existing config you want to back up, create your dotfiles
repository, then run `stow .zshrc --adopt` (CAREFUL with `--adopt`) to set the
contents of your dotfiles' `.zshrc` for example, to what you have configured at
`~/.zshrc`. You can also map packages like `nvim`, `doom`, etc. you just need to
follow the right directory hierarchy as shown above.

### Installing on a fresh machine

Typically if I'm installing on a machine that has an existing configuration for a package, I'll use the `--adopt` directive for GNU stow, then do a `git restore`. Here's what that looks like:
1. Clone the repo and `cd` in there.
2. For each package in the repo that you want symlinked, run `stow <package>`. You will need to use `--adopt` if the package already exists on the machine. This creates a symlink for the package to your dotfiles repo.
3. If you want to use the config you had previously stored in your dotfiles repo, then run `git restore <dir>` or `git restore .` if you're feeling wild. If you want to **overwrite** the neovim config you had in your dotfiles repo with the one you have currently at `~/.config/nvim`, then don't do the restore.

> [!WARNING] 
> The `--adopt` flag *will* overwrite the contents of your current
> directory with the contents from your target directory. Please be careful.

## Doom Emacs

To get the clipboard working on x11, you need `xclip` installed. I think I installed it with
1. `<M-x> package install`
2. `xclip`

Just make sure it's on your system and you should be able to use your system clipboard with emacs.

On Mac you need `pbcopy` which you can install with `<M-x> package`.

``` emacs-lisp
;; use system clipboard
(require 'pbcopy)
(turn-on-pbcopy)
```

I think you should be able to just yoink my doom emacs config then run `doom
sync`. There may be some missing packages, but you should be able to install
them with `<M-x> package-install`.

## Neovim

1. If you have an existing neovim installation, delete any existing runtime dir
   you have for neovim to prevent errors in your new version.
   `usr/local/nvim/runtime`. See :checkhealth of your current neovim install to
   confirm what the path is on your machine.
2. [Install the nightly version of neovim][nightly] - I have some plugins, I
   can't remember which ones (treesitter maybe?) that require the nightly
   version of neovim as they use the latest features. I just install from
   source.
3. [Install Packer][packer] - this is the package manager I use for lua
   dotfiles.
4. Run `nvim`
5. Type `:PackerSync` or `:PackerInstall` (need to double check this on a
   *fresh* install) - This will install all of your nvim plugins.
6. You may have to run `:TSUpdate` 'cause treesitter is fussy,

## Tmux

1. [Install tpm][tpm]
2. Add plugins to `~/.tmux.conf`
3. Run tmux (or reload tmux env `tmux source ~/.tmux.conf`)
4. Install plugins with `prefix + I` (capital i)

## Yubikey auth on your machine

When you create a new SSH key, you can use `ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident` for a 2FA SSH key stored on your Yubikey.

## NixOS

I have a machine running NixOS, here's what I learned when getting started.
First, all of the available packages are found at https://search.nixos.org. To
update NixOS, you can use `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` to rebuild your nix config
and update your packages added to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`.

I currently just manually copy my config file to this repo. It's not currently
symlinked like my other config files. Also this could definitely use a clean up,
but that's a problem for futurebunni.
